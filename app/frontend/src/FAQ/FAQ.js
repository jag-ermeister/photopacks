                    Go for variety. Use photos with good lighting, diverse
                    facial expressions and backgrounds. Photos should be cropped
                    close to your face or body, but donâ€™t cut of a part of your
                    head. High quality photos make for high quality generations.

                    PhotoPacks.AI will never sell your data. We use your photos
                    to train our AI models to learn about your photo subject.
                    The images you upload and generate are only available to you
                    and will never be shared publicly without your explicit
                    consent. The images that are generated are yours to do with
                    whatever you wish.

                    You will receive your photos in 24 hours or less. Often

                    on the capacity of our AI-learning servers.
